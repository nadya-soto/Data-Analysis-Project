📊 README for Stage 1: Data Exploration 🔎
🌟 Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a system that predicts surplus energy availability from renewable sources (🌬️ wind and ☀️ solar energy) at least 24 hours in advance. The goal is to provide 🌱 free energy to local communities near renewable energy sources during surplus periods.
🚀 How to Run the Code:

Follow these steps to get started with the data exploration code:

    Download the dataset: Get the dataset from the Assessment Information page on Moodle 📥.
    Install Jupyter Notebook: Make sure Jupyter Notebook is installed. If not, you can install it via Anaconda or pip:

pip install notebook

Clone or download the repository: Clone or download the repository containing the data exploration code 📂.
Open the notebook: Launch the Data_Exploration.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook:

    jupyter notebook Data_Exploration.ipynb

    Run the notebook: Execute each cell in sequence to load, clean, and preprocess the dataset 📊, and explore thresholds for surplus energy ⚡.
    Review the comments: Be sure to check the comments in the notebook to understand each step 💬.

🔑 Assumptions:

    The dataset contains the necessary information for predicting surplus energy availability 📅.
    Research from external sources will help define appropriate thresholds for surplus energy 📚.

📂 File Overview:

    Data_Exploration.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook includes:
        🛠️ Data loading, exploration, and cleaning
        📊 Data preprocessing and analysis
        🔎 Research on surplus energy thresholds
    README.md: This file! It provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and details about the files 📄.

🧑‍💻 Code Explanation:

    Data Loading: The first section loads the dataset and gives an overview of its structure 📦.
    Exploration: Basic statistics and visualizations help you understand the dataset better 📉.
    Cleaning and Preprocessing: Missing values are handled, and transformations are applied to prepare the data for analysis 🔧.
    Surplus Energy Research: Based on external research, we explore the best thresholds to identify surplus energy ⚡. Results are documented for later modeling 📚.

🧠 Research and References:

    Relevant research and references about surplus energy thresholds and renewable energy forecasting are included within the notebook 📘.
