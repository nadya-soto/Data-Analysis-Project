# 📊 **README for Stage 1: Data Exploration** 🔎

## 🌟 **Project Overview**:
This project aims to develop a system that predicts surplus energy availability from renewable sources (🌬️ wind and ☀️ solar energy) at least 24 hours in advance. The goal is to provide 🌱 **free energy** to local communities near renewable energy sources during surplus periods.

## 🚀 **How to Run the Code**:
Follow these steps to get started with the data exploration code:

1. **Download the dataset**: Get the dataset from the **Assessment Information** page on Moodle 📥.
2. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: Make sure Jupyter Notebook is installed. If not, you can install it via Anaconda or pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. **Clone or download the repository**: Clone or download the repository containing the data exploration code 📂.
4. **Open the notebook**: Launch the `Data_Exploration.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Data_Exploration.ipynb
   ```
5. **Run the notebook**: Execute each cell in sequence to load, clean, and preprocess the dataset 📊, and explore thresholds for surplus energy ⚡.
6. **Review the comments**: Be sure to check the comments in the notebook to understand each step 💬.

## 🔑 **Assumptions**:
- The dataset contains the necessary information for predicting surplus energy availability 📅.
- Research from external sources will help define appropriate thresholds for surplus energy 📚.

## 📂 **File Overview**:
1. **`Data_Exploration.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook includes:
   - 🛠️ Data loading, exploration, and cleaning
   - 📊 Data preprocessing and analysis
   - 🔎 Research on surplus energy thresholds
2. **`README.md`**: This file! It provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and details about the files 📄.

## 🧑‍💻 **Code Explanation**:
- **Data Loading**: The first section loads the dataset and gives an overview of its structure 📦.
- **Exploration**: Basic statistics and visualizations help you understand the dataset better 📉.
- **Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Missing values are handled, and transformations are applied to prepare the data for analysis 🔧.
- **Surplus Energy Research**: Based on external research, we explore the best thresholds to identify surplus energy ⚡. Results are documented for later modeling 📚.
