# README for Stage 1: Data Exploration

## Project Description:
This project aims to develop a system to predict surplus energy availability from renewable sources, specifically wind and solar energy, at least 24 hours in advance. The ultimate goal is to offer free energy to local clients near renewable energy sources during periods of surplus energy.

## Instructions on How to Use/Run the Code:
1. Download the dataset provided from the Assessment Information page on Moodle.
2. Ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed on your system.
3. Clone or download the repository containing the code for data exploration.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook file named "Data_Exploration.ipynb" using Jupyter Notebook.
5. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to load and explore the dataset, perform data cleaning and preprocessing, and conduct research on thresholds indicating surplus energy.
6. Make sure to read the comments and descriptions provided in the notebook for better understanding.

## Assumptions:
1. The dataset provided contains relevant information necessary for predicting surplus energy availability.
2. External sources will be consulted for determining appropriate thresholds indicating surplus energy.

## Description of Files:
1. Data_Exploration.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing code for data exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, and research on surplus energy thresholds.
2. README.md: This file providing instructions and information about the project.

## Explanation of Code:
- The notebook is organized into sections for data loading, exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, and research.
- Each section includes code cells with explanations and comments to guide the exploration process.
- Descriptive statistics, visualizations, and data preprocessing techniques are applied to understand and prepare the dataset.
- Research findings and references regarding surplus energy thresholds are documented for future reference.



Please feel free to reach out for any clarifications or assistance during the data exploration process.
